# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basics _AGAIN_

**Thoughts**: Though I know basic C programming out of my curiousity, JavaScript is more liberal than this. In short, I love the syntax!

---

### Day 1: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn about variables declaration, data types, parseInt(), parseFloat, toFixed() method.

**Thoughts**: Wonder how easy to implement and write any pre-written method to a program. Look forward to learn more!!

---

### Day 2: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn about array (declaration, indexOf() method index searching, charAt() push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice() method).
2. Learn about conditionals (if/else statements, switch statements)
3. Basic construction of a function.

**Thoughts**: When I practice the array's indexOf() method, I get confused with search by the index and by the array element. MDN Documentation helped me a lot with that topic. I find the function very interesting though.

### Day 3: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn more about functions and arrays.
2. Learn about loops (while, do..while, for).

_screenshot generated from [Code Time](https://www.software.com/). Although, I have been using **Waka Time** for a great amount time but it cannot generate more than a week's report in its free version. Then today, I tried out **Code Time** and honestly I'm impressed._

**Thoughts:**
Today, I learn many new things about input validation, function management, and the importance of creating a super cool function that prevents "DRY". I had a great day.
