# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basics _AGAIN_

**Thoughts**: Though I know basic C programming out of my curiousity, JavaScript is more liberal than this. In short, I love the syntax!

---

### Day 1: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn about variables declaration, data types, parseInt(), parseFloat, toFixed() method.

**Thoughts**: Wonder how easy to implement and write any pre-written method to a program. Look forward to learn more!!

---

### Day 2: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn about array (declaration, indexOf() method index searching, charAt() push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice() method).
2. Learn about conditionals (if/else statements, switch statements)
3. Basic construction of a function.

**Thoughts**: When I practice the array's indexOf() method, I get confused with search by the index and by the array element. MDN Documentation helped me a lot with that topic. I find the function very interesting though.

---

### Day 3: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn more about functions and arrays.

**Thoughts:**
Today, I didn't code much as I have the final exam tomorrow. Although, I fixed some bugs on an existing project. I'm thinking of revising those topics that are confusing to me in just two days. Let's hope for the best.

### Day 45: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Today, I again revisited some advanced topics in JavaScript like, class, prototypal inheritance, **_this_**, closures, callback functions, hoisting, event loop, and objects. Tomorrow, I will be starting to learn React.

### Day 46: September 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Today, I learned the legendary command `create-react-app` and coded a "Hello, world" program. However, I mostly explored the React doc.

**Thoughts:**
Tomorrow is my other final exam, that's why I didn't want to take much pressure. Hopefully, I will be able to learn it well from tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
Today, I relaxed a bit. Although I wanted to learn some more things in React, I realized that maybe I shouldn't take pressure to learn new things today. Hopefully, from tomorrow.
