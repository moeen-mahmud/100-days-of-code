# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn the basics _AGAIN_

**Thoughts**: Though I know basic C programming out of my curiousity, JavaScript is more liberal than this. In short, I love the syntax!

---

### Day 1: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn about variables declaration, data types, parseInt(), parseFloat, toFixed() method.

**Thoughts**: Wonder how easy to implement and write any pre-written method to a program. Look forward to learn more!!

---

### Day 2: August 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn about array (declaration, indexOf() method index searching, charAt() push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice() method).
2. Learn about conditionals (if/else statements, switch statements)
3. Basic construction of a function.

**Thoughts**: When I practice the array's indexOf() method, I get confused with search by the index and by the array element. MDN Documentation helped me a lot with that topic. I find the function very interesting though.

### Day 3: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Learn more about functions and arrays.
2. Learn about loops (while, do..while, for).
3. Solved around 15 beginner javascript problem question.

**Thoughts**:
Today I discover an amazing thing which is how to take user input from node command line. Though the process is not as easy as normal browser prompt, but I enjoy this.

### Day 5: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Learn about the basics of recursive function
2. Revise everything I learn from day zero.

**Thoughts**:
I find the recursion on JavaScript is a bit weird. Solved a program that finds the nth Fibonacci number using recursive function. Look forward to solving more problem questions.

### Day 6: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Learn nothing new today.
2. Have practised [Hackernoon's](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-practical-coding-challenges-for-beginners-4bq3ugr) problem questions again.

### Day 7: August 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Learn the application of various Math functions, ie, Math.abs(), min(), max(), round(), ceil(), floor(), random()
2. Learn how to swap to swap variable and use of destructuring with an array.
3. Learn how to use recursion to find nth Fibonacci in a series.

**Thoughts**:
I've practised more problem questions by applying what I learned today. Though, I struggled a bit in the recursion method and finding the nth Fibonacci using that method. Hope I will overcome my confusion in the following days.

### Day 8: August 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**

1. Learn how to use for...of loops.
2. Solved a bunch of code challenges relating to array, loops and conditions.

**Thoughts**:
Today was great for me because I learned a lot of new things while solving the coding challenges. Mainly, I was able to remove my confusion in the arrays and loops, and I'm looking forward to practising the next day and revising the previous learnings once again.

**Thoughts**:
I don't know how much time should I practice coding. But I think today is enough and will look forward to the next day.
